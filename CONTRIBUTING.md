# Contributing to Oglama

Thank you for your interest in Oglama.

At this time contributions to this project are restricted to members of the internal development team.

**We are not currently accepting pull requests from external contributors.**

### Why are contributions restricted?

Oglama is part of an internal initiative and is developed exclusively by our core team. This ensures that development aligns with specific internal goals and timelines.

### How to stay updated?

Even though contributions are closed to the public, we encourage you to follow the project for updates and new releases.

-   If you encounter bugs or have suggestions feel free to contact us directly at <hello@oglama.com>.
